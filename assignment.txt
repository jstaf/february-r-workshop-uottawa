In an R markdown document, use R's built-in "iris" dataset (dataset <- iris).

Get the summary of the dataset, and examine it with str() and other functions.

Compute the mean and standard deviation of petal.length for each species.

Plot a box plot of petal.length by species.

Use R's built in Titantic data set (dataset <- Titanic).

Figure out the number of sex/class combos that either survived or did not.

Write these results to csv. (use write.csv(data, filename, row.names=FALSE))

Make a plot of the frequency of each outcome (survived, did not survive) by class of passenger ticket.
